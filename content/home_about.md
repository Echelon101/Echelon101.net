Hello, I am Kevin aka. Unkn0wnCat, a gamer, coder and video editor.

I currently primarily play Rainbow Six: Siege with my clan, <a href="https://kreig.de">KREIG</a>, but I also play ArmA 3 and Garry's Mod.

If I am not gaming in my free time I'm most likely coding. If you'd like to find out more about that you might want to visit my personal website at https://kevink.dev.

My third passtime is video editing, which you can always witness on my YouTube channel.
